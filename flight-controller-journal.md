## 12/27/2025 6 PM - Started schematic design  

_Time spent: 2.5h_  

I started the schematic design for the controller and I installed the easyeda2kicad library to make it easier I also learned how to pick out parts and look at a data sheet and design a schematic from it. I have trouble installing the library but I figured it out eventually

## 12/27/2025 11 PM - Finished schematic design  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

I finished the schematic design and started assigning footprints, I had a little bit of trouble finding the right inductors and caps but I found the eventually

## 12/28/2025 2 AM - Started PCB design  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

started the actual PCB design, currently I am in the organization stage putting the decoupling resistors and caps where they need to go as close as possible. Had a little bit of trouble because the microSD card footprint wasn't showing up but I figured it out!

## 12/28/2025 1:54 PM - Finished organizing everything  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

I finished organizing all of the components into there groups to make it easier later I had no trouble this part I actually kinda enjoyed it I also put everything in groups

## 12/28/2025 9 PM - Routed Part of the PCB  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

Organized into the size I wanted and also started routing everything not done yet though, I struggled a little bit with some of the traces because I forgot to change the clearance but after I figured it out it was smooth sailing.

## 12/29/2025 - I finished the PCB  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

I finished the PCB and it looks great I double and triple checked literally everything but I locked it and I had zero issues. I did ocd it a little and I was making sure all the traces where evenly spaced but super excited.
